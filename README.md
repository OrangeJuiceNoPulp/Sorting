This program compares merge sort with bubble sort, allowing the user to see the difference in time efficiency between the two sorting algorithms.


The program allows the user to specify the length of an array of random integers (between 0 and 100, including 0 and excluding 100) that will be created and then sorted using the two sorting algorithms (merge sort and bubble sort).


The runtime of each sorting algorithm is displayed in seconds to three decimal places (because that is the limit of the program's precision, otherwise more decimal places could be displayed but would just have 0 for their value).


After using this program, it should be apparent to the user that merge sort is a more efficient algorithm than bubble sort because it is able to sort integer arrays faster for arrays of large length.
